# DCDiagReport

This script runs DCDiag /v on all your domain controllers and exports a simple 'Passed' / 'Failed' result for each test into a nicely formatted and filtered Excel SpreadSheet.

It doesnt return any error messages when there is a failure so you need to go and investigate any that you may be worried about but its handy to get a quick snapshot or top level view of your DCs health.
